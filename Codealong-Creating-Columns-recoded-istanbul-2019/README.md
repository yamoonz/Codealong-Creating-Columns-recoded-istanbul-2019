# CSS Columns Code Along Exercise

## Overview

In this code along exercise we will add column structure to our page layouts.
All the files you need to follow along are provided and opening this code along
on the in-browser IDE will fork and clone down a copy for you, but if you would
like to continue working from your personal `exceptional-realty` repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your_username_here>/exceptional-realty
cd exceptional-realty
```

You'll want code along on a new branch, not `master`, so create a new branch called `columns`.

**Remember**, make sure to add, commit and push up the work you've done on your `columns` branch, then merge the work into your `master`, pushing up the `master` as well!
